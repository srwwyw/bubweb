                    <h3>Kanye West: The Main Character of the Rap Game (Fr fr)
                        So boom  Kanye Omari West popped out the womb on June 8, 1977, in ATL but was raised in Chi-town (aka Chicago).
                        Dude didnt just walk into the game,
                        he moonwalked in with a pink polo and a backpack,
                        disrupting everything like your fav messy friend in a group chat.
                        Before he was Yeezus, Ye was just a beat nerd cookin on the MPC.
                        He produced bangers for Jay-Z, Alicia Keys, and Ludacris, but industry folks were like nah you just a producer.
                        Kanye said bet and dropped The College Dropout (2004) 
                        and that sh*t was different. Like, genre-bending, soul-sampling, God-talking, and insecure-yet-cocky-vibes-in-one
                        kinda different.
                        From there, Ye went on a main quest with side missions in fashion, architecture, and Twitter rants.
                        <br>    Every album hit a new vibe: <br>
                        <br>
                        Late Registration  baroque and boujee <br>
                        808s & Heartbreak  auto-tuned sadness before it was cool <br>
                        My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy  peak art, no skips, Grammy robbed <br>
                        Yeezus  industrial rage-core, not for the weak <br>
                        Jesus Is King  gospel Ye unlocked <br>
                        <br>
                        Then came the Kardashian Era. He married Kim K, had 4 mini-Yees, and made headlines like it was his 9 to 5.
                        They eventually split and the timeline got wild, not gonna lie. Ye beefed with everyone from Drake to Pete Davidson,
                        ran for president (yes, actually), and tweeted like a chaotic neutral NPC.
                        Through all the memes, meltdowns, MAGA hats, and makeups, Ye stayed Ye  unpredictable, unfiltered,
                        and literally too real for cancel culture to keep up.
                        Love him or roast him, heâ€™s def a walking cultural reset. Rap game, fashion scene, techhe left fingerprints everywhere.
                        And no cap, even when hes off the rails, were all still watching like.

                <h3> If YE has a million fans, then I am one of them. 
                    If YE has ten fans, then I am one of them. 
                    If YE has only one fan then that is me. If YE has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. 
                    If the world is against YE, then I am against the world.
